Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. 
Its importance: it enables the creation of of software applications that power various aspects of modern living insectors such as fmcg, healthcare, educational, etc
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
establishemnt of software engineering as a subject of learning, establishemnt of programming languages to enbale programmers and developers work to be easy, and the development of agile methodologies to enable developers to respond to customer needs and integrate them in the systems
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Reguiremnet analysis: here, the developer gathers the necessary information from the customer and integrate accordingly
Design: the developer now does the real achtechct of the program
Implementation: writing and building the code
Testing: this ensures that the product meets quality and standards
deployment: the product is relasesed for use in the public
maintenance: here is the customer support and updates
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer will design, build, program, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. a quality assurance engineer will find and fix bugs in the project, while project manager will be the team leader to ensure clients expectations are met
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
allow developers to track changes, commit updates, and merge code efficiently. IDEs with these features enhance teamwork by integrating these control systems directly into your development workflow. while VCS facilitates coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. It enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Advancement of Technology
Technology evolves at a phenomenal rate and leads to added pressure for software engineers. From learning and staying up-to-date on concepts such as stack and JavaScript to writing code, software engineers juggle a variety of tasks to fulfill their duties. The ability to leverage tech trends in software product development gives professionals a cutting edge over competitors and allows them to stand out in a highly competitive market. 
Growing Customer Demands: Software engineers generally work with conceptual projects designed and developed to meet varied customer demands. Even within the simplest application or product, software engineers must work toward understanding underlying business concepts and introduce required features to satisfy the needs of the consumer. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests: Are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server.
Integration tests: verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. For example, it can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. These types of tests are more expensive to run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running.
Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
System tests: type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated project

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vaque prompts Lacks of clarity can confuse the AI. For example, asking "What is this?"
